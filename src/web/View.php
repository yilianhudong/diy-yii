/**
 * View represents a view object in the MVC pattern.
 *
 * View provides a set of methods (e.g. [[render()]]) for rendering purpose.
 *
 * View is configured as an application component in [[\yii\base\Application]] by default.
 * You can access that instance via `Yii::$app->view`.
 *
 * You can modify its configuration by adding an array to your application config under `components`
 * as it is shown in the following example:
 *
 * ```php
 * 'view' => [
 *     'theme' => 'app\themes\MyTheme',
 *     'renderers' => [
 *         // you may add Smarty or Twig renderer here
 *     ]
 *     // ...
 * ]
 * ```
 *
 * For more details and usage information on View, see the [guide article on views](guide:structure-views).

     * existing [[context]] will be used.
